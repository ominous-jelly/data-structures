# Python Data Structures

This is simply for me to help keep track of what I'm learning as I progress in my Python skills.

There's nothing usable here, but there are some decent notes, if that's what you're into.

Feel free to use/clone/alter/ignore/suggest. That's what the repo is public for after all.
