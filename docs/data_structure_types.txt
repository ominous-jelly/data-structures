Linked lists are a "chain" of "nodes". They are implemented as a class.
The most important part of a linked node is the "Head Node". From here
it will be possible to continue down the chain of nodes all the way to
the tail.

Doubly linked lists are similiar to linked lists except that they have
a value and TWO pointers. One is pointing to the next node, the other to
the previous node.
